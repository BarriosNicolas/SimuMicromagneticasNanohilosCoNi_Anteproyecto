The chapter discusses main magnetization reversal modes, domain wall types, and state diagrams in cylindrical nanowires of different types and sizes. The results of the hysteresis process in individual nanowires and nanowire arrays also are presented. Modeling results are compared with experimental ones. The chapter also discusses future trends in nanowire applications in relation to simulations, such as current-driven dynamics, spintronics, and spincaloritronics. The main micromagnetic programs are presented and discussed, together with the corresponding links.}

  abstract = {Advances in nanofabrication now allow us to manipulate magnetic material at micro- and nanoscales. As the steps of design, modelling and simulation typically precede that of fabrication, these improvements have also granted a significant boost to the methods of micromagnetic simulations (MSs) and analyses. The increased availability of massive computational resources has been another major contributing factor. Magnetization dynamics at micro- and nanoscale is described by the Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert (LLG) equation, which is an ordinary differential equation (ODE) in time. Several finite difference method (FDM) and finite element method (FEM) based LLG solvers are now widely use to solve different kind of micromagnetic problems. In this review, we present a few patterns in the ways MSs are being used in the pursuit of new physics. An important objective of this review is to allow one to make a well informed decision on the details of simulation and analysis procedures needed to accomplish a given task using computational micromagnetics. We also examine the effect of different simulation parameters to underscore and extend some best practices. Lastly, we examine different methods of micromagnetic analyses which are used to process simulation results in order to extract physically meaningful and valuable information.}

  abstract={Computational micromagnetics is widely used for the design and development of magnetic devices. The theoretical background of these simulations is the continuum theory of micromagnetism. It treats magnetization processes on a significant length scale which is small enough to resolve magnetic domain walls and large enough to replace atomic spins by a continuous function of position. The continuous expression for the micromagnetic energy terms is either derived from their atomistic counterpart or result from symmetry arguments. The equilibrium conditions for the magnetization and the equation of motion are introduced. The focus of the discussion lies on the basic building blocks of micromagnetic solvers. Numerical examples illustrate the micromagnetic concepts. An open-source simulation environment was used to address the ground state of thin film magnetic element, initial magnetization curves, stress-driven switching of magnetic storage elements, the grain size dependence of coercivity of permanent magnets, and damped oscillations in magnetization dynamics.},

To fulfill this task, simulations have always pushed the limits of what is possible in terms of software and hardware. In this perspective, we give an overview of the current state of the art in micromagnetic simulations of ferromagnetic materials followed by our opinion of what tomorrow’s simulations will look like. Recently, the focus has shifted away from exclusively trying to achieve faster simulations, toward extending pure micromagnetic calculations to a multiphysics approach. We present an analysis of how the performance of the simulations is affected by the simulation details and hardware specifications (specific to the graphics processing unit-accelerated micromagnetic software package mumax3), which sheds light on how micromagnetic simulations can maximally exploit the available computational power. Finally, we discuss how micromagnetic simulations can benefit from new hardware paradigms like graphics cards aimed at machine learning.}",
